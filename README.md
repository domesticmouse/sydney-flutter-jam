# Sydney Flutter Jam

This repository contains the code for the Sydney Flutter Jam, being run
as part of the Sydney GDG.

## Week 1

Week 1 contains the tidied up source code from Sydney Flutter Jam #1, divided into three parts, along with a bonus 4th section not covered on the night.

 - [Step 1](week1/week_1_step_1/) has a simple getting started Flutter app, made with `Material` widgets.
 - [Step 2](week1/week_1_step_2/) adds hard coded locations for a couple of Google offices around the world.
 - [Step 3](week1/week_1_step_3/) loads the locations from a JSON API endpoint. Here endeth the code covered on the night.
 - [Step 4](week1/week_1_step_4/) re-does the app using the `Cupertino` widgets, and adds in loading the images for the offices.

 I have published a write up exploring these steps in greater detail on Medium as 
 [Sydney Flutter Jam #1](https://medium.com/@domesticmouse/sydney-flutter-jam-1-7132dc643cd8).

Please note, these samples are tracking dev channel, not beta.

 ## Week 2

Week 2 contains the tidied up source code from Sydney Flutter Jam #2, divided into three parts, along with a bonus 4th section not covered on the night. The goal was to create a simple Todo app that communicates with Firebase

 - [Step 0](week2/week_2_step_0/) has the code you cas use as a starting point. A simple list of hard coded todos.
 - [Step 1](week2/week_2_step_1/) adds text input to create new todos.
 - [Step 2](week2/week_2_step_2/) adds the necessary configuration to communicate with Firebase
 - [Step 3](week2/week_2_step_3/) loads, adds, update, deletes todos from Firebase.
 - [Step 4](week2/week_2_step_4/) extracts some of the Firebase logic and abstracts it away behind a BLoC

Please note, these samples are tracking dev channel, not beta.
